# Cloning

If you're new to git, cloning is basically downloading a copy - with an ability to push updates.  It's safe to make as my clones as you want, they're just folders on your computer, the server doesn't know about them.  So if you clone something, screw it up, but want to keep it around for reference, just clone another folder with a _2 at the end

You can either download the zip or run "git clone url" from command line.  Either way, click the root page of this repo, drop down the green button and make your selection

The folder can be anywhere.  Visual Studio defaults to something like users\name\repos\source.  Personally, I like to make a !dev_repos folder at the root of my hard drive and put all repos there.  It's easy to find and has a low risk of long folder names messing things up

If you're just going to download, there's no need for any special git tools.  But if you're going to make your own repo, create a github account.  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download) is a good tool for managing repos.  You can clone directly from it, or if you've already cloned something, you can add a repo later.  VSCode and Visual Studio have git abilities as well, but I wouldn't trust visual studio when dealing with files outside of the solution
